# WCI-URMC-Catchment-Area-Characterization
Characterization of the Catchment Area for Wilmot Cancer Institute

This project was done in collaboration with Dr. Ramsdale, an oncologist at the Wilmot Cancer Institute. Although the project was done as a part of our Data Mining course, it serves as a starting point for a grander project by cancer control teams at WCI, where I will continue to work on this project and play my role as a data science intern.
